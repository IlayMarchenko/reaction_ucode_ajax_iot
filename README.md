**Hello everyone! This is my fifth challenge in course from Ucode IT Academy featuring Ajax Systems.**

## The main idea  ✨

**How to process information from sensors correctly.**

## Our equipment :hammer:

* **TI LaunchPad CC1352R1**
* **TI Sensors BoosterPack “BOOSTXL-SENSORS”**

## What is my project about  😮

**Sensors bme280 and opt3001 measure temperature and lux. Moving average filter filter raw data. If the temperature is lower than 30 degrees - red led is off, if the temperature is higher that 34 - red led is on, if the lux is lower that 15 - green led is on, if the lux is higher that 25 - green led is off.**

## How you could run it  🏃

**To run and flash this project you could use Code Composer Studio. Note that you need to install SDK to work with the Launchpad.**
